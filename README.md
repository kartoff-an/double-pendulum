# Double Pendulum Animation
A simple simulation and animation of a double pendulum using the Runge-Kutta 4th Order (RK4) numerical method implemented in C++ and visualized using SFML 3.0.2. This project demonstrates the chaotic motion of a double pendulum system.

## Features
- Real-time animation of a double pendulum
- RK4 method for accurate numerical integration.
- Adjustable parameters for rod lengths, masses, and initial angles.
- Simple and lightweight SFML-based visualization.

# Requirements
- **C++17** or higher.
- **SFML 3.0.2** installed.

## Installation

### 1. Install SFML 3.0.2

Download SFML 3.0.2 from the [official website](https://www.sfml-dev.org/download.php) for your platform and follow the installation instructions.

### 2. Clone this repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/kartoff-an/double-pendulum
cd double-pendulum
```

### 3. Configure `tasks.json` (in VS Code)

It is already included in the repository for you. Modify if necessary.

### 4. Build and run

## Controls / Parameters
- Adjust initial angles, masses, or rod lengths in `main.cpp`.
